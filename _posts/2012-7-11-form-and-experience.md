#The Relation between Form and Experience

from: tennis.

thesis: form is a shortcut to experience. It is a way for others to pass on the lessons they have learned.

counter: be sure to challenge and ask about why the form is used. If the reason is bad, __don't do it__!

===

For the purposes of this post, we will take 'form' to mean an idea which is learned first by rote in order to build subconcious (sometimes muscle) memory in an area where the learner is not yet proficient.



Sometimes, one does not need to know form. If it's something that you can get intuitively, trying to learn form will hinder you. It will either tell you things you already know, or it will teach you things that *you* don't need to complete that activity or exercise.

For instance, there are some things that I just "get." I get some math. I get digital logic. I don't know why I do, but it just is.

Hopefully, in reading this, you reacted with distaste towards the idea of learning something by repetition/rote. Why would you do something without knowing why? What if it's the wrong thing to do?
