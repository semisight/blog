#Resolution

I know I've been neglecting this site somewhat since I started school. I have posts in the works (just check the repo on [github](https://github.com/semisight/blog)), but I haven't touched most of them in over a month.

I want to change that.

From now on, I want to lower the bar on how much I will write per post. Instead of writing a small essay each time, I want to be okay with one or two paragraphs. I'm not going to try to change everything overnight--those types of resolutions never work. Instead, I'm going to try to [modify my behavior](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/01/behavior-by-design.html) so that I want to post more.

After all, a post is (most often) about persuasively conveying a point. Anything has more effect than not posting at all.
