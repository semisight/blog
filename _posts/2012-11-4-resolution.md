#Resolution

I know I've been neglecting this site somewhat since I started school. I have posts in the works (just check the repo on [github](https://github.com/semisight/blog)), but I haven't touched most of them in over a month.

I want to change that.

From now on, I want to lower the bar on how much I will write per post. Instead of writing a small essay each time, I want to be okay with one or two paragraphs. After all, a post is about persuasively conveying a point. Anything has more effect than not posting at all.

I'm going to set reminders all over the place so that I don't forget about this small corner of the net that I have acquired for myself. Time will tell if it works.
