#The Day I Became a Geek

I don't believe that I was always as 'smart' as I seem to be now. I'm not hyper-intelligent. I'm certainly no genius. But I am curious, and I am driven.

I can remember the exact moment when something clicked inside me; when I became more than I was (for that brief moment). An epiphany of such magnitude that as a 4 year old I could not comprehend its impact on my life until years later. By the time I could, it was simply a part of me. It was, at first, an observation on an activity that I had just learned.

But enough beating around the bush, do you want to know what it was? Get ready, here it comes. No more delaying. Just the quote. What I realized that night was that "if other people can do it, it can't be that hard."

Well, that was anti-climactic. But as usual, the most important things in life are also the most simple. To this day, that realization of a four year old is what drives me to bigger and better things.

What drives you?
