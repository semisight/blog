#How I Learned Colemak (and How I'll Apply it to Other Goals)

This March I set out to learn to type. I have been hunt-and-peck typing for as long as I can remember, and I had gotten pretty fast at it. To me, touch typing was a fantasy--it is potentially fast, but I found it painful and slow. At the same time, I did think of myself as on the right track to being a decent programmer.

Until recently, I had had no motivation to learn to type. If it were not for [Steve Yegge's rant](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html), I would still be hunting. Thankfully, Yegge's argument got to me. I had always known I needed to learn, but reading the article was like having the truth slap me in the face. My ego wounded by Yegge's harsh comments, I decided to get to learning.

##What is/why Colemak?

[Colemak](http://colemak.com/) is a keyboard layout for the computer age. It is a spiritual evolution to the Dvorak keyboard. Whereas Dvorak was invented to increase hand movement efficiency on typewriters, Colemak applies the same idea to computers.

Here it is!

###What's the difference?

I'm glad you asked! Basically, Colemak is a less extreme redesign of Qwerty than Dvorak is. If you look at the picture above, you'll notice an odd familiarity in the bottom row. Aside from the letter N, which is moved to the home row, the bottom row is entirely unchanged from the Qwerty format. This is to help preserve the muscle memory built with common key combinations like Ctrl-X/C/V (or Command on OS X). Because these letters are already uncommon, it is ok to leave them in the bottom row. Even if it is not perfectly optimal, it ends up being better for most people because it eases their transition. Other than the bottom row, Colemak also leaves Q, W, A and H in their Qwerty places.

Also, as a OS X/Unix programmer, Dvorak is not a good choice because it places L and S under the right pinky, making `ls` or `ls -l` frustrating and slow to type.

##Bigger and better things

The reason I didn't give up on this was because I was able to take it on my own pace. I didn't commit to "5 days a week at the gym," or "2000 calories max." I initially wrote 10-15 minutes a day touch typing. Now that I've seen the success of [doing little things many times](http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/01/behavior-by-design.html), I think I may apply it to [other things](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/) as well.

That may have to wait for another day however.
