#Avoiding semi-mathy

Semi-what? Let's back up a bit. I'm sure many people are familiar with the idea of a bilingual person. A bilingual is an individual who can speak fluently in two languages. This concept can be extended--a trilingual speaks three languages, and above that, people are generally referred to as multilinguals or "polyglots." For an example of one polyglot, see this traveling man's website (link benny the irish polyglot).

Not as many people know that there is another label which is in many ways opposite to that of bilingualism. Unfortunately, there exists a group of people that have grown up with two languages, but fail to master *either*. These people are known as semilinguals.

##But the Title?

The idea of a polyglot can be generalized beyond just languages: when one person is good at multiple things, he or she may become known as a poly*math*. Just as there are polymaths, I believe there are also semimaths.
