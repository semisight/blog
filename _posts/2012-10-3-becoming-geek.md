#The Day I Became a Geek

I don't believe that I was always as 'smart' as I seem to be now. I'm not hyper-intelligent. I'm certainly no genius. But I am curious, and I am driven.

I can remember the exact moment when something clicked inside me; an epiphany of such magnitude that as a 4 year old I could not comprehend its impact on my life until years later. I realized that night was that "if other people can do it, it can't be that hard." Turns out, it's true. For years, I wondered about calculus, and whether it really was as hard as people say. It isn't. I did it, veni, vidi, vici.

As usual, the most important things in life are also the most simple. To this day, that realization of a four year old is what drives me to bigger and better things.

What drives you?
