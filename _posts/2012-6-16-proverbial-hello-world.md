##Hello, World
This will be my "real" personal website. I will be using the ever friendly Jekyll along with hosting provided by Amazon S3. This post is in markdown, and is filler content I will use to test my CSS theming.

Now that I have your attention, I will highlight some code. The code is stupid, and doesn't do anything useful. It is a good test however! Let's see how it looks...
{% highlight python linenos %}
class foo(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.arr = []
		return self

	def __repr__(self):
		return 'omnomnom' + ', '.join(arr)
{% endhighlight %}
After the code, a paragraph continues. There should not be any small caps on this paragraph.
