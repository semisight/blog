##Hello, World
Finally, I'm starting a "real" personal website. I will be using the ever friendly Jekyll along with hosting provided by Amazon S3.

The web holds so much promise, and now it's cheap too!

###Third level header
flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow flow.

Now to highlight some code:
{% highlight python linenos %}
class foo(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.arr = [];
		return self

	def __repr__(self):
		return 'omnomnom' + ', '.join(arr)
{% endhighlight %}
After the code, a paragraph continues. There should not be any small caps on this paragraph.
