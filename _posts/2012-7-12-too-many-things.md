##We have too many (cheap) things

Thesis: when things get cheaper, it makes it easier to buy what we don't need.

Case in point, the two games I bought at the summer steam sale. Did I need them? No. I'm not trying to diss video games. In fact, what I have wanted for a while is an fps game that I could play multi-player on.

Counter: You're just trying to uphold a standard to which no one can aspire--we all have our guilty pleasures.

Answer: I'm not trying to tell you that you should only buy what you need to survive. I'm trying to warn against the effect that sales have psychologically on people, because once you recognize something that has power over you, you can begin to take control. You cannot fix a blindspot by definition. This is the same reason that alcoholics must start therapy by first admitting that they have a problem.
