#What Makes You You
##Identity Part 1

There is an old riddle about a Greek ship, where, as the ship ages, the oldest planks are replaced with new ones. After a time, as one might imagine, the last original plank gets replaced, and no piece of the ship is left in the ship. At this point, the ship as it exists is not the same ship as the ship that was first built. If one were to save the old planks as they were taken out, they could rebuild the old ship *next to the new one*.

Clearly, the 'new' ship is distinct from the old one. The question is, at what point does the ship become *not what it once was*? After you replace the first plank, is it reasonable to say the ship is still the same ship? (I would guess that most people would say yes). What of two pieces? 25 percent of the ship? 50 of it? Where is the boundary at which the ship becomes distinctly a different ship?

Do the pieces even define the ship at all? Or rather, is it the structure (i.e. the idea) of the ship that defines its core identity? (Sorry for the mass of questions. This is a philosophical exercise, so we have to find the right question before we can find our answer). I think we can show from rebuilding the old ship alongside the new one that the original parts are a part of the identity of the old ship.

At this point, it might be easy to demarcate 50% as the percentage at which some object changes identity. Unfortunately, that doesn't work for a whole host of reasons. First of all, what makes that last plank, that one plank that makes >50% so special? It is no different unit wise from any of the other planks you've replaced before.

We can neatly side-step this whole ordeal by refusing one of our original assumptions. We assume that identity is binary - that something is until it isn't. But that may not be true. We can take identity as fluid, as a continuum. This creates some disturbing conclusions for human identity, but at this point I'm way out of scope and out of my areas of expertise. I'm no Philosophy major, I'm a programmer.

Let's make the problem easier. What about *digital* identity? In the next post in this two part series, we'll reel this back in and explore online identity.
