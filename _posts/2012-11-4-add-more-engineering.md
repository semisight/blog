#Add More Engineering

A little over a year and a half ago, I was enough lucky to count myself among the roughly 210 individuals privileged enough to attend Olin College of Engineering's (henceforth Olin) Candidate Weekend. For those of you who don't know, Candidate's Weekends are three weekends (you only attend one of the three) where 70 students per weekend spend two days at Olin getting to know the campus. At the same time, Olin only gives acceptances to a bit less than 2/3 of those students, so acceptance is not guaranteed at this point, although your odds are significantly higher. Olin views Candidate's Weekend as a chance to "get to know you" (read: judge you on your fitness for acceptance), although they are explicit that the only time your performance is measured is in the group and individual interviews on the second day.

At the time, Olin was the closest school I had to a top choice (among others like Cal, USC, MIT, GA Tech--keep in mind this is still application season, not quite decision season, so I hadn't heard back from many of these schools). A lot about Olin excited me. It was a school not afraid to be different, not afraid to step off the beaten path paved by US News and payed for with the extravagant non-dischargeable federal loans of thousands of naive new students each year. The original charter for the school was for the institution to give a full-ride to all those attending (after the '08 crash this was downgraded to a half scholarship). At Olin, they have what I believe to be a healthy outlook towards education--they value a hands-on environment with an emphasis on entrepreneurship and teaching all aspects of designing a product, as opposed to many schools that still have the idea that they should churn out job-ready workers with a very well-defined path and resume.

At the same time, Olin was and is *very* small. They advertise proudly on their tour as having 350 beds (i.e. max capacity), and take into account that students are expected to stay on campus (all 4 buildings of it) for all four years. They admit that some of their students get "cabin fever" during the long winters. Even though they are about 45 minutes out from Boston, the administration was very clear that they prefer students to engage in activities around campus instead of leaving to go into town.

I knew the pros and cons, and I remember being cautiously optimistic going into it. I knew that as a white male, my chances of getting into an engineering college that valued an even gender ratio were slim. However, I was determined not to waste any chance given to me.

##Meet the Team

The first day was fun all the way through--the candidates were taken on tours (for those who had not been there before), shown the on-campus clubs, and put into teams to do some fun challenges (as well as to build camaraderie amongst the team before the team interview on the second day). At the end of it all, the students and faculty leading the activities gave out "awards" on the spot based on what the teams had done that day. One team got a "Bernie Madoff" award, and it may have been my team, but honestly I can't remember anymore.

The first day was also the first time that, since I had been on Olin campus, I felt a sort of dissonance between me and the students (and candidates). There's no other way to put it: they were weird. As I was to find out on the second day, this is what was selected for.

##The Group Interview

The second day started at 9am sharp. It was raining and snowing the night before, but now the sky was clear, the air crisp like it only can be after it rains, and I was feeling good. I was ready to compete, to fight for the attention of an increasingly picky group of educators. We were informed after breakfast that the trials of the day would be broken down into two parts--the first would be as a group, and the second, alone. We were fortunately in the same groups as the day before, so I knew the people I was working with. The problem they gave us was, to summarize: "here is a sheet of numbers about the Boston transit system (also known as the 'T'). Make it profitable."

That hour flew by. Even looking back on it, it felt like 20 minutes at the very most. We divided up, then came back and produced ideas at rapid-fire speed. By the end, I loved what we had made. I would have gone to bat for our proposal. If the city of Boston had come to me and asked me to help implement it, I would have put off college. It could have worked. After time was up, we were asked to present it to the professors in the class. And we did. I thought it went very well. I thought that maybe, possibly, I was in.

The faculty member observing had other ideas. After the hour concluded, we presented our ideas more formally (although she had already heard them). Instead of asking specifics, or clarification, her first question directed at the team was (and I'm paraphrasing), "don't you want to *add more engineering*?"

That sentence told me, in no uncertain terms, that *I* would never attend Olin. I had happened to step up and be the first person to speak when we started planning our ideas, so I had framed the question the way I saw it--I saw it primarily as a business question, with engineering as a secondary concern. As her question implied, the professor disagreed with my interpretation. She did not see our solution as being representative of an engineer; by association, I was not a good candidate for the school.

My individual interview after that was more of an interrogation. My heart wasn't in it. When I got back to my room at the Babson Conference Center, I told my dad about it. He thought it might have been the attitude that she had with everyone, but to me, she had seemed pretty clear.

##Afterwards

As you can guess, I did not get into Olin. To be honest, I was not particularly disappointed. I think I would have gone crazy at Olin--I simply am not odd enough to fit in with the rest of the student population.

###Is Olin Right for You?

If you're reading this right now, and you're a candidate or considering applying, please understand that this was one person's experience with the college. I wish Olin had meshed with me. It is a great school with a radical curriculum that in my opinion other schools could learn a lot from. Unfortunately, it didn't. It wasn't the right fit for me, but that doesn't mean it won't be for you. You need to see the campus, and experience candidate's weekend/a college visit for yourself. If you are an eccentric and you love it, you may love it here. If a night on the town is anathema to you, but a hackathon with Redbull is exciting, Olin should be a serious consideration.
