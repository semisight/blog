#Add More Engineering

A little more than a year and a half ago, I was among the roughly 210 individuals privileged enough to attend Olin College of Engineering's (henceforth Olin) Candidate Weekend. To be honest, I went into it a bit conflicted. At the time, Olin was the closest school I had to a top choice (among others like Cal, USC, MIT, GA Tech--keep in mind this is still application season, not quite decision season, so I hadn't heard back from many of these schools).

A lot about Olin excited me. It was a school not afraid to be different, not afraid to step off the beaten path paved by US News and payed for with the extravagant student loans of thousands of naive young people each year. The original charter for the school was for the institution to give a full-ride to all those attending (although after the '08 crash that was downgraded to a half scholarship). At Olin, they have what I believe to be a healthy outlook towards education--they value a hands-on environment with an emphasis on entrepreneurship and teaching all aspects of designing a product, as opposed to many schools (mine unfortunately included) who still have the idea that they should churn out job ready workers with a very well-defined path and resume. Of all of their classes, the one I was most looking forward to was called Foundations of Business and Engineering, where students are allocated funds to start and liquidate a business in one semester.

At the same time, Olin was and is *very* small. They advertise proudly on their tour as having 350 beds (i.e. max capacity), and take into account that students are expected to stay on campus (all 4 buildings of it) for all four years. They admit that some of their students get "cabin fever" during the long winters. Even though they are about 45 minutes out from Boston, the administration was very clear to say that they prefer students to engage in activities around campus (a work-is-play attitude, one which I don't mind at all).

All of this in mind, I remember being cautiously optimistic going into it. I knew that as a white male, my chances of getting accepted were still slim. But I had gotten this far, and I was determined not to waste any chances given to me.

##The Group Interview

The second day started at 9am sharp. It was raining the day before, but now the sky was clear, the air crisp like it only can be after a rain, and I was feeling good, and on my guard for the "judging."
