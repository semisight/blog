##Add More Engineering

A little more than a year and a half ago, I was among the roughly 210 individuals privileged enough to attend Olin College of Engineering's (henceforth Olin) Candidate Weekend. To be honest, I went into it a bit conflicted. At the time, Olin was the closest school I had to a top choice (among others like Cal, USC, MIT, GA Tech--keep in mind this is still application season, not quite decision season, so I hadn't heard back from many of these schools).
