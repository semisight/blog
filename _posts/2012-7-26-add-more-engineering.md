#Add More Engineering

A little over a year and a half ago, I was lucky to count myself among the roughly 210 individuals privileged enough to attend Olin College of Engineering's (henceforth Olin) Candidate Weekend. To be honest, I went into it a bit conflicted. At the time, Olin was the closest school I had to a top choice (among others like Cal, USC, MIT, GA Tech--keep in mind this is still application season, not quite decision season, so I hadn't heard back from many of these schools).

A lot about Olin excited me. It was a school not afraid to be different, not afraid to step off the beaten path paved by US News and payed for with the extravagant student loans of thousands of naive young people each year. The original charter for the school was for the institution to give a full-ride to all those attending (although after the '08 crash that was downgraded to a half scholarship). At Olin, they have what I believe to be a healthy outlook towards education--they value a hands-on environment with an emphasis on entrepreneurship and teaching all aspects of designing a product, as opposed to many schools that still have the idea that they should churn out job-ready workers with a very well-defined path and resume.

At the same time, Olin was and is *very* small. They advertise proudly on their tour as having 350 beds (i.e. max capacity), and take into account that students are expected to stay on campus (all 4 buildings of it) for all four years. They admit that some of their students get "cabin fever" during the long winters. Even though they are about 45 minutes out from Boston, the administration was very clear that they prefer students to engage in activities around campus instead of leaving to go into town (a very work-is-play attitude, one which I don't mind at all).

Keeping all of this in mind, I remember being cautiously optimistic going into it. I knew that as a white male, my chances of getting accepted were still slim. But I had gotten this far, and I was determined not to waste any chance given to me. I knew that part of this was about competition, and I was determined to win just for the sake of winning alone.

##The Group Interview

The second day started at 9am sharp. It was raining and snowing the night before, but now the sky was clear, the air crisp like it only can be after a rain, and I was feeling good. I was ready to compete, to fight for the attention of an increasingly picky group of educators. We were informed after breakfast that the trials of the day would be broken down into two parts--the first would be as a group, and the second, alone. We were fortunately in the same groups as the day before, so I knew the people I was working with. The problem they gave us was, to summarize: "here is a sheet of numbers about the Boston transit system (the 'T'). Make it profitable."

Man that hour flew by. Even looking back on it, it felt like 20 minutes at the very most. We divided up, then came back and produced ideas at rapid-fire speed. By the end, I loved what we had made. I would have gone to bat for our proposal. If the city of Boston had come to me and asked me to help implement it, I would have put off college. It could have worked. After time was up, we were asked to present it to the professors in the class. And we did. I thought it went very well. Until I heard the sentence that told me, in no uncertain terms, that *I* would never attend Olin. When that bio professor leaned in, and asked us "don't you want to *add more engineering*?"

I could go on and on about why that's a terrible question. But I won't.
