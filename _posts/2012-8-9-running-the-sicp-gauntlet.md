#Running the SICP Gauntlet

It's time. I've told myself that I'd do this for a long time, but I've kept putting it off. I am starting the uphill battle that is… doing every exercise in the second edition of *Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programming*. You can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/semisight/sicp).

##Why do this?

Why try to complete a textbook that was last updated in 1996 (when I was just three years old)? If you google "best programming books" (or something along those lines), you'll find that this book is among the most common. It is hailed as a classic by some, and a necessary read by many more. However, there is only one way to know if you've understood the material, and that is to apply it. Doing these exercises keeps me honest about what I do and do not understand. I could skim this book in a day or two, but it would accomplish nothing. Instead, I aim to prove to myself that I have absorbed all that this book has to offer.

##Solution viewer

If you look inside the sicp repo I linked to above, you'll see that there is a file (right now called test.py) that is distinctly *not* related to the exercises. I intend to write a javascript viewer (hosted in the web-experiments section of this website) that will parse my solution files and allow one to view my solutions to each exercise in a more friendly form than pure text. I don't know when I'll find time to finish this part (right now, test.py takes a solution file as input and outputs an array of exercises), but I hope to have it done before I finish the book.

##Errors in solutions

Please read the README in the sicp repo before emailing/commenting/submitting a pull request! I want to know that my solution to problem *x* fails with input *y*, but I want to figure the solution out on my own! Remember:
