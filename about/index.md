##About...

###Myself
My name is Alex Bogart. I am a computer engineering student at University of Southern California. Programming is simply what I like to do.

###This Site
This site is named "bit limn." Bits are the fundamental unit of information (as those who are reading this may well know). Limn is a verb, meaning "to describe or depict." When I chose that name, I wanted to represent the fact that I think of computer programming as an art form. It depicts the artist's intentions, as best they can describe them.

###My "Experiments"
I strongly believe in doing what one loves. I love programming. I love building things, from the small to the large. My experiments are what others would call projects. I call them what I do because I don't want them to be associated in any idea of work--I take joy in the act of creating the same way a runner takes joy implicitly from running, or like an artist takes joy in painting.

###Contact Me
It is my first name at this website.
