#About Me

My name is Alex Bogart. I am a computer engineering student at University of Southern California. Programming is simply what I like to do.

##This Site
This site is named "bit limn." Bits are the fundamental unit of information (as those who are reading this may well know). Limn is a verb, meaning "to describe or depict." When I chose that name, I wanted to represent the fact that I think of computer programming as an art form. It depicts the artist's intentions, as best they can describe them.

##My "Experiments"
I will take advantage of this site to host different small (and possibly large) client-side web projects that I think up. The web experiments page is where I intend to host them.

There are currently no experiments up here.
