###My "Experiments"
I strongly believe in doing what one loves. I love programming. I love building things, from the small to the large. My experiments are what others would call projects. I call them what I do because I don't want them to be associated in any idea of work--I take joy in the act of creating the same way a runner takes joy implicitly from running, or like an artist takes joy in painting.
